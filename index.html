    <p style="font-size:20px;" ><strong>The smell of perfume is often associated with positive emotions such as happiness, love, and excitement. This is because the scent of perfume can activate the part of the brain that is associated with pleasure. When we smell something that we like, our brain releases dopamine, which makes us feel good</strong></p>
